USB library 2.0 and C examples

support@labjack.com

This package contains the liblabjackusb 2.0 USB library for low-level U3, U6
and UE9 USB communications and examples written in C.  The examples demonstrate
basic open/write/read/close operations using the liblabjackusb library, and also
demonstates the use of U3, U6 and UE9 low-level functions command/responses, 
which are fully documented in Section 5 of the LabJack U3, U6 and UE9 User
Guides.

Refer to the INSTALL file for library requirements, and installation
instructions. Note that the exodriver requires libusb-1.0.

Command/response times for USB were tested with the Feedback function (noted
in Section 3.1 of the LabJack U3, U6 and UE9 User Guides), and match the
measured Windows execution times.

Contents of this package:

The liblabjackusb directory contains the following:
   * The liblabjackusb library source and header files, labjackusb.c and
     labjackusb.h, and Makefiles for Linux and Mac OS X.

The examples directory contains the following:
   * This directory contains U3, U6 and UE9 examples source files written in C
     in their respective directory.  The examples use the labjackusb header file
     in the liblabjackusb directory and the liblabjackusb library in the
     /usr/local/lib directory.  The applications created from the code run in a
     terminal.  The files u3.h/u6.h/ue9.h, and u3.c/u6.h/ue9.c contain functions
     that open and close a USB connection, calculate checksums, get analog
     calibration information, and more.  In addition, there are 5 "easy" 
     functions (eAIN, eDAC, eDI, eDO, eTCConfig and eTCValues), which are
     similar to the same named "easy" functions in the LabJackUD driver for
     Windows.  All other files are examples that demonstrate device specific
     low-level functions and "easy" function usage.

The INSTALL file provides requirements and installation instructions for the
liblabjackusb library, along with instructions on building the examples.
