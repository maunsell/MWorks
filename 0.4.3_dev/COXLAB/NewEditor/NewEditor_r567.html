<li>More featureful snippets are now pulled in from the library.  For instance, pulling in
    a task system brings along two basic states</li>
<li>Dragged-in/pasted elements now auto-rename themselves to avoid name collisions</li>
<li>A very basic, not-yet fully functional experiment graph viewer has been added.
