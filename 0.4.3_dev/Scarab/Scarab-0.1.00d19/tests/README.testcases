/*
  This file contains an Opossum parsable description of the results
  of two calls to ldo_read() in an LDO-Binary implementation on the
  included testcase.ldobinary.  

  Likewise, an implementation should produce the same contents as
  testcase.ldobinary if it serializes the first dictionary below, creating
  a reference to it in the process, then transmitting the reference.  
  
  You should note however, that you needn't maintain the same order
  in the dictionary (i.e. its not an error for the keys to be in a 
  different order)
