   The Distributed Component Object Model protocol is an
   application-level protocol for object-oriented remote procedure
   calls useful for distributed, component-based systems of all
   types. It is a generic protocol layered on the distributed
   computing environment (DCE) RPC specification and facilitates the
   construction of task-specific communication protocols through
   features such as: a platform neutral argument/parameter marshaling
   format (NDR), the ability for objects to support multiple
   interfaces with a safe, interface-level versioning scheme suited to
   independent evolution by multiple parties, the ability to make
   authenticated connections and to choose levels of channel security,
   and a transport-neutral data representation for references
   (including by-value) to objects.
Tcl-DP http://www2.cs.cornell.edu/zeno/Projects/tcldp
   A distributed programming extension to Tcl/Tk. Adds TCP and IP
   connection management, RPC and distributed object support to
   Tcl/Tk.

======================== Data Representation =========================

RFC 1014 XDR: External Data Representation Standard
RFC 971 A SURVEY OF DATA REPRESENTATION STANDARDS
http://www.java.sun.com/products/jdk/rmi/doc/serial-spec/protocol.doc.html
Python's pickle.py
ObjC?'s serialization (similar to pickle, tho)
WDDX http://www.wddx.org/
<http://www.dejanews.com/[ST_rn=qs]/getdoc.xp?AN=238231884> refers to
   the following encodings among some other interesting notes:
   1 - ASN.1 
   2-63 - Reserved for IANA assignment for future versions of OSI ASN.*.
      - For all ASN.* codings, the subcoding indicates what encoding
        rules are in use as listed  below.

        ASN.* SUBCODINGS
        0 - reserved.
        1 - BER ( Basic Encoding Rules [BER] ).
        2 - DER ( Distinguished Encoding Rules [DER] ).
        3 - PER ( Packed Encoding Rules ) Aligned.
        4 - PER Unaligned.
        5 - CER ( Canonical Encoding Rules ).
        6 - SNMP Restricted BER
        7-253 - available for IANA assignment to future OSI encoding
             rules.
        254 - private.  This subcoding will never be assigned to a
             standard set of encoding rules. The OID will appear as
             part of the data.
RFC 1698 "ThinOSI Upper-Layers Cookbook" contains a reference to
   compressed integers as part of BER/ASN.1
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-low-sdr-00.txt
   This document describes a human-readable, textual syntax for
   representing self-describing structured data. This representation
   was designed as a transfer syntax for loosely-coupled distributed
   applications where one cannot depend on sender(s) and receiver(s)
   sharing a schema for exchanged data. The syntax is compact,
   expressive, intuitive, and simple to implement.
