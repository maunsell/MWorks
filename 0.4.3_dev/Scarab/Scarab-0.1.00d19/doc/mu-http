Micro-HTTP servers in apps

I'm going to confuse things here for a bit and mention that we're also
playing with an interface that allows an app to simply make it's
variables available as a hierarchy, like URLs or /proc.  You can use
simple GET and PUT requests to retrieve and update them.  This can be
done either with object messages as described elsewhere or using a
micro-HTTP server in the app.  The micro-HTTP servers-in-apps will be
supported by LDO clients, and we've prototyped a C version using Jef
Poskanser's thttpd (tiny/turbo/throttling HTTP server), which is about
60KB.  The prototype for the micro-HTTP server API is in the Casbah
cvsweb under `api1-examples', and an actual C implementation is in
<http://www.ntlug.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/api1-examples/api1-a/app-info-c.c?rev=1.1>
