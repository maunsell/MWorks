Scarab

Scarab is a set of libraries implemented in several languages for sending
XML and other messages over HTTP, TCP/IP, and other transport
protocols.

Scarab is very modular and supports several higher and lower level
protocols in a consistent way.  All of the libraries are implemented
with a similar API but tailored to the unique features of each
language.

This package contains modules for the following protocols and
languages:


Language   TCP/IP  HTTP  SOAP XML-RPC LDO-XML LDO-Binary
Python       X                           X        X
Perl         X                           X        X
Java         X                                    X
C                                                 X
